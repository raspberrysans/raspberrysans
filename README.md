### 👋 Welcome to my GitHub profile!
> I came to Seoul, South Korea as an international student in 2017 under the Global Korean Scholarship and I graduated with a Bachelor's in Computer Science from Yonsei University in February 2022 (연세대학교). By day, I’m a front-end developer, and by night I write, edit, and create. <br />
> Check out my website <a href="https://www.sansverse.co/"> here </a>

### 👀 I’m interested in:
> 1. Web & app development
> 2. Creative design (UI/UX)
> 3. ML, CV, NLP (AI)
> 4. Content creation
>
